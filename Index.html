All my favs!

<p>  One of my favorite parts about traveling is finding hidden gem whether that is a new restaurant, cute shop, or breathtaking sights. I let you in on my favorite places and maybe some places that I would skip.</p>

<H2> My Time in California: Capture the Moment!</H2>
<p> The best part about traveling is making memories, but don’t forget to document them. Take the picture! Take the video!
Let this photo from my trip to Palm Springs, California inspire you to take more photos. I was blown away by this stunning view. This hiking trail took you into the palm trees and through the mountains. My family decided to hike to a spring on the map which was unfortunately almost dried up. As people always say, it's about the journey – not the destination.</p>

<h2> My Latest Adventures</h2>
<h3>Rome</h3>

<p> I had the once in a life time opportunity to visit Rome with some of my best friends. Some of my favorite parts had to be seeing gorgeous churches, going to the Colosseum, and trying delicious gelato shops!</p>

<h3>New York</h3>

<p>
This winter, I took a short trip to NYC with my family. I had never been there during the holiday season, but it sure didn’t disappoint. As someone who danced growing up, seeing the Rockette's perform was a bucket list item.
